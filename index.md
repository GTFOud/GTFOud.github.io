**GTFOud** (Get The File Out - upload/download edition) is a curated collection of legitimate [functions][] of scripting languages, utilities, libraries, packages, and binaries that can be leveraged to transfer files — from a local system to a remote target and vice-versa — for privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration on compromised systems, even in restricted environments ([help][] menu)

It is important to note that this is **not** a list of exploits, and the programs listed here are not vulnerable per se, rather, GTFOud is a compendium about how to live off the land when you only have certain binaries available.

GTFOud is a [collaborative][] project created by [S.C.P Labs][] where everyone can [contribute][] with additional binaries and techniques, and is inspired by [GTFOBins][] and [LOLBAS][].
This project focuses exclusively on file transfer techniques and primitives that work out-of-the-box using native or pre-installed tools in Unix-like and Windows environments.
