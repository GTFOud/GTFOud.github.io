**GTFOud** (Get The File Out - upload/download edition) is a curated collection of legitimate scripting languages, utilities, binaries, libraries, packages, and tools that can be leveraged to transfer files — from a local system to a remote target and vice-versa — for privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration on compromised systems, even in restricted environments.

Inspired by [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io) and [LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io) this project focuses exclusively on file transfer techniques and primitives that work out-of-the-box using native or pre-installed tools in Unix-like and Windows environments.
